Significant changes have been made to the new consultation paper on TER regulations, sources said.
                        <br>
                        The mutual Fund industry has been in anticipation of the new draft paper on TER regulations since a month. Madhabi Puri Buch, Chairperson at Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had in June said that the market regulator will release a revised consultation paper on the same. She said that industry would be quite pleased with the new paper.

                        The variety in banking and financial sector mutual funds and which one to pick.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The BFSI sector houses some of the largest listed companies in India. It is the backbone of the Indian economy. With rising acceptance of financial products by various segments of the economy – broadly known as financialisation – companies in this sector have grown with increased digitalisation. Given the low penetration of financial services, the sector has a long growth pathway. The sector has three key segments – lenders including banks and non-banking financial companies, insurance companies, and financial services companies including brokerages, exchanges, asset management companies, depositories, and registrar & transfer agents. Each segment has different growth drivers and enjoys valuations accordingly. Public sector banks are seen as cyclical investments as they tend to do well when capital expenditure in the economy catches up, which is happening now. On the other hand, companies in the financial services and insurance sub-sectors are more long-term structural stories wherein shareholders bet on their wider presence among the masses amid economic growth and development.</p>

                        A healthy love affair continues as healthcare stocks remain MF darlings</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Mutual fund (MF) houses continued pouring money into the healthcare sector in June, a trend that has been consistent in recent months.

                        Previously, the healthcare sector had grabbed the biggest chunk of mutual fund investments in May, at Rs 1,900 crore according to Emkay Alternative and Quantitative Research's Monthly Institutional Flow Tracker.
                        <br>
                        The interest in the sector has grown so big that 10 out of the 11 mutual fund houses covered by Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research have gone overweight on pharma and healthcare, as against their weightage in Nifty 200.
                        <br>
                        Pharma and healthcare commands a 4.88 percent weightage in Nifty 200 while 10 MF houses have allocated 4.97 percent to 10.67 percent of their total allocations to the sector as of June, Nuvama's report revealed.</p>
