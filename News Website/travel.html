                    <p class="text-center">Airbnb, the popular online lodging platform, has offered some of the weirdest and most outrageous rooms or homes to its customers. While some end up becoming moments to remember, others turn into quite odd experiences.
                        <br>
                        David Holtz, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley, recently shared his experience of booking a room at an Airbnb, which wasn't as expected. He shared a picture of his room which had a bed installed right next to a commode seat without any partition. A bathroom sink was in front of the bed, while the shower space was also very close.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">It can be easily said that a trip to Kashmir is not considered complete if you don’t enjoy a houseboat stay. It is for this reason that the very beautiful Dal Lake has long been synonymous with the vibrant houseboat experience and community. These houseboats have also been one of the primary reasons for attracting tourists to the valley from all across the globe.
                        <br> However, the aging houseboats over the years have suffered and are in dire need of repair, which has been presenting a significant challenge to their existence and the livelihood of those who call them home.</p>

                        The theme park was constructed with a budget of Rs 27 crore, not Rs 28 crore as previously mentioned.</p>

In recent days, temperatures in Xinjiang and other parts of Asia, as well as Europe and the United States have shattered records, adding new urgency for nations around the globe to tackle climate change that scientists say will make heatwaves more frequent, severe and lethal.</p>
